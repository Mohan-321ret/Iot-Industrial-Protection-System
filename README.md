IOT BASED INDUSTRIAL PROTECTION SYSTEM 

OBJECTIVE

Today, smart grid, smart homes, smart water networks, intelligent
transportation, are infrastructure systems that connect our world more than we ever
thought possible. The common vision of such systems is usually associated the
Internet of Things (IoT), where through the use of sensors, the entire physical
infrastructure is closely coupled with information and communication
technologies; where intelligent monitoring and management can be achieved via
the usage of networked embedded devices. These devices will connect to internet
to share different types of data. We have proposed an Industrial Monitoring System
using WIFI module and sensing based applications for internet of things. By
detecting the values of sensors it can easily find out the Temperature, humidity, and
gas present in the industrial area.

Block diagram explanation of the key components involved in this system:

Industrial Sensors:
The system starts with various industrial sensors that are used to monitor
critical parameters such as temperature, pressure, humidity, gas levels,
vibration, etc. These sensors are strategically placed throughout the industrial
environment to gather real-time data.

Arduino Board:
The Arduino board acts as the main controller of the system. It receives data
from the industrial sensors and processes this information. Arduino boards
are selected based on the specific requirements of the application. Arduino's
flexibility and ease of use make it an ideal choice for prototyping and
implementing IoT systems.

Connectivity Module:
To enable IoT functionality, the Arduino board needs a connectivity module,
such as Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or GSM/GPRS. This module allows the Arduino to
communicate with the internet and send the collected data to a cloud server .

Cloud Server:
The data sent from the Arduino is received and stored in a cloud server. The
cloud server serves as a central repository for data storage and processing. It
enables data visualization, historical analysis, and access to real-time data
from any location with internet connectivity.

Data Analytics:
The cloud server may employ data analytics algorithms to process the
received data. These algorithms can detect patterns, anomalies, and trends,
providing valuable insights into the industrial processes' performance and
health.

User Interface:
A user interface is created, either as a web application or a mobile app, to
provide a graphical representation of the data and control options. This
interface allows users, such as industrial operators or managers, to monitor
the status of the industrial processes, view sensor readings, and access
historical data.

Alerting System:
An essential feature of the protection system is the alerting mechanism. When
the system detects abnormal conditions or potential dangers, it triggers an
alert. Alerts can be in the form of visual notifications .

Industrial Control:
As the system aims to protect industrial operations, it may include control
features to manage specific processes or equipment. For example, based on
sensor data and analytics, the system can adjust parameters of industrial
machines to optimize performance or prevent malfunctions.

Advantage:
1. This system can be noticed easily all fault on scrolling LCD display. Therefore
trouble-shooting is easy..
2. Reduces man power
3. Easily implementable.
   
Application:

1.Maintenance Department for troubleshooting fault.
2. Quality Department for improvement
